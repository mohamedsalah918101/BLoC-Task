# 🎨 Dealing with Different Types of BLoCs  

Welcome to the **BLoC Exploration Lab**! This project is all about leveraging the power of Flutter's BLoC architecture to create a responsive, dynamic, and theme-aware app.

## 🛠️ Features
### 🚀 **Two Custom BLoCs**
1. **CounterBloc**: Tracks and updates a simple integer counter.
2. **ThemeBloc**: Toggles the app's theme between light and dark modes.

### 🎯 **Bloc Essentials in Action**
- **BlocListener**: Displays a SnackBar when the counter hits specific milestones.
- **BlocBuilder**: Updates the UI whenever the counter changes.
- **BlocConsumer**: Combines listening and building, showing the counter and a SnackBar for key counter values.
